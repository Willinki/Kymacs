# Kymacs

### My own vanilla-emacs distro.

Based on the extremely helpful videos by https://systemcrafters.cc and other
resources found around the web.  This Emacs distribution is aimed at students
whose workflow includes programming and taking (scientific) notes.  Also it is made for MacOS.

## Features:
* Most programming related packages: magit, projectile, conda, lsp-mode, etc...
* Enhanced vanilla Emacs experience (cape, consult, marginalia, embark, orderless, vertico) based on the
  tutorials made by system crafters (Emacs from scratch) and on [crafted-emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs)
* Language support: bash, lisp, python, c++, R, Julia, Latex
* Fully fledged org environment: agenda, capture, roam, babel
